Hi there! My name is **Mohammed Mouafik**, and I am a 💻 22 year old Junior Web Developer 💻 based in 📍 Morocco.

I am currently in my third year at university studying 🔋 Computer Science, and I am passionate about learning software engineering and problem solving using Python 🐍. My ultimate goal is to become a 🤖 Software Engineer 🤖, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date 🧪 in my field.

In terms of my professional skills, I am proficient in back-end technologies such as PHP, Python, and SQL, and am familiar with C. I also have experience in front-end development using React.js and Next.js, as well as HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
